# Age-Based Personalized Music Recommendation

## Description
An intelligent music recommendation engine that addresses the **"cold-start" problem** for new users on streaming platforms. By leveraging **age and basic preferences**, it delivers tailored song suggestions without requiring extensive listening history. The system analyzes musical tastes across generations using machine learning, adapting to individual interests when users select genres or eras.

## Key Features
- **Demographic-First Approach**: Focuses on age groups to provide instant recommendations.
- **Genre/Era Adaptation**: Refines suggestions based on user-selected preferences.
- **Mental Health Potential**: Supports mood improvement and stress reduction through therapeutic music.
- **AI-Powered DJ Capabilities**: Creates seamless mixes for various occasions (workouts, relaxation, etc.).
- **Low-Barrier Entry**: Ideal for novice users with minimal input requirements.

## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning**: Collaborative filtering, demographic-based modeling.
- **Backend**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
- **Data**: Music datasets with age-group preferences (data-set collected by me through survey).

## Use Cases
1. **Streaming Services**: Onboard new users with instant recommendations.
2. **Mental Health Apps**: Curate therapeutic playlists based on age and mood.
3. **Event DJ Systems**: Generate real-time mixes for different age groups.
4. **Nostalgia-Driven Apps**: Rediscover music from specific eras.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate **listening habits** over time for hybrid recommendations.
- Integrate with **voice assistants** (e.g., Alexa, Siri) for hands-free control.
- Expand to **multi-modal inputs** (e.g., combining mood tags with age).
